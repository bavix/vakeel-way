// StateService is a gRPC service that allows clients to update a list of UUIDs.
//
// The service provides the ability to update a list of UUIDs. The list of UUIDs
// is sent as a stream of UpdateRequest messages. Each UpdateRequest message
// contains a list of UUIDs that need to be updated. These UUIDs are used to
// uniquely identify the request and can be used to track the request throughout
// the system.
//
// The service is used to test that the gRPC service is working correctly. This
// is done by sending a stream of UpdateRequest messages and receiving a single
// UpdateResponse message in return. The UpdateResponse message is an empty
// message that indicates that the update operation was successful.
//
// It is also used to mark services as working for some time. If services stop
// sending information about themselves, then they do not work and it is
// necessary to notify monitoring and create an incident.
